Dude, just finished watching Becoming Led Zeppelin, and I'm kind of all over the place right now. Like, first off, I gotta say, the early days of the band were totally bonkers. They were just these kids with mad talent and no clue of the craziness that awaited them. I swear, it's always wild to see how legends start, right? You know what I mean?

And then, oh man, the footage! It's like they just pulled me back in time. Makes you want to download the movie right away so you can pause every scene and just soak in all the 70s hairdos and vibes. Seriously, Plant's hair was its own character, I swear! 😂 I could barely keep up with everything; they were all just so damn young and full of energy. It made me feel both super hype and kind of exhausted at the same time.

> But like, the whole thing had this weird vibe, like some parts were all dramatic and other bits just flew by without much punch, like oh hey, let’s toss in some casual genius here. Idk, sometimes these rock docs are a mess, but in a kinda entertaining way, you know what I mean? It's just insane how just four guys could transform the entire music scene, though.

Right, and there's this one moment—had me giggling—where they’re talking about just wanting to play music and suddenly they were dealing with insane crowds and even crazier parties. Imagine going from “let’s jam, dudes” to “holy crap, we need bodyguards.”

Ahhh, tbh, after watching the movie, I got this overwhelming urge to just dive into their discography and lose track of time in their epicness. Also, that John Bonham, man, what a beast on the drums! Like an octopus caught in a rock and roll storm or something. 🤘

Also, random thought, do you ever think about how different everything would be if Zeppelin weren’t a thing? Like, whole ripples through music history and all that. Anyway, time to catch some Z’s ‘cause this movie marathon life's no joke. Definitely need some sleep to recharge before I dive back into the real world. Catch you later! 😴
